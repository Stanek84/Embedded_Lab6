Lab6_Q1.c
  In this document, code is written which uses the internal temperature reader in the MSP430 to collect data. That data is then read inside of Code Composer Studio. The reason for this code being written is in response to question one in Lab 6 for Embedded Systems.
  
Lab6_Q2.c
  In this document, code is written that reads two different sensors, the internal temperature of the MSP430 and a photoresistor installed on a boosterpack. This data is then turned into characters that can be used in the next lab. The reason for this code being written is in response to question two in Lab 6 for Embedded Systems.
